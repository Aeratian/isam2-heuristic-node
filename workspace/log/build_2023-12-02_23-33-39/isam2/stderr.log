CMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:29 (find_package):
  By not providing "Findgtsam.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this project has
  asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by "gtsam", but
  CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "gtsam" with any of
  the following names:

    gtsamConfig.cmake
    gtsam-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "gtsam" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set
  "gtsam_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above files.  If "gtsam"
  provides a separate development package or SDK, be sure it has been
  installed.
